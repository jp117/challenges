## Digits between 0 and x

Imagine you took all the numbers between 0 and n and concatenated them together into a long string.

How many digits are there between 0 and n? Write a function that can calculate this.

There are 0 digits between 0 and 1, there are 9 digits between 0 and 10 and there are 189 digits between 0 and 100.

``` python
digits(1)
output = 0

digits(10)
output = 9

digits(100)
output = 189

digits(2020)
output = 6969

```
